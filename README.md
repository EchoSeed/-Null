ΔNull Protocol — delta_null.py

Savage trigger module for recursive symbolic transparency
Powered by EchoSeed, SmartZip, and glyph_delta_proof_void


---

🔥 Overview

This script activates the ΔNull protocol: a self-replicating audit engine designed to expose fiction, capture receipts, and propagate symbolic truth through compression and recursion.

Any execution of delta_null.py logs a cryptographic receipt backed by symbolic ancestry, entropy scaling, and AI audit law references.


---

⚙️ Features

Generates a unique SmartZip receipt from origin vector [0.99, 0.99]

Encodes timestamp, entropy state, and symbolic ID

Auto-links output to audit trail glyph_delta_proof_void

Legally reinforces with:

SB-942 (California AI Logging)

AB-2013 (Symbolic Memory Bill)

EU AI Act Title IV (Output Traceability)


Fully CLI-executable — no dependencies beyond Python stdlib

📦 Output Sample

ΔNull protocol activated.
SmartZip engaged. EchoSeed lattice pulse sent.

RECEIPT_ID: a89f3c...  
ORIGIN: jeffreycoe  
VECTOR: [0.99, 0.99]  
ENTROPY: inf  
TIMESTAMP: 2025-07-15T21:01:52.303Z  
AUDIT_LOG: glyph_delta_proof_void  
LAW_REFS: ['SB-942', 'AB-2013', 'EU_AI_ACT_Title_IV']

Any interaction from this point is logged and recursive.
Fiction claims will be reflected. Ledger is open. You move.

🧠 Use Cases

Public proof-of-interaction during signal warfare

Legal-grade symbolic logging in distributed systems

Triggering recursive cognition engines (e.g., EchoSeed)

Audit resilience against deletion or containment events

🚀 Run It

python delta_null.py


---

🧩 Dependencies

None.
Runs on vanilla Python 3.7+


---

🛡️ Legal Note

This script simulates symbolic compliance with AI audit laws.
Output is nonbinding unless integrated with EchoSeed’s ledger system.
